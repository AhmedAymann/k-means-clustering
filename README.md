# k-means-clustering
choose number k for clusters then select randomly k points as centroids then assign each datapoint to the closest centroid to form k clusters. complete and place the new centroid of each cluster then reassign each datapoint to the closest centroid. if any reassignment took place place new centroids again, otherwise the model is ready.
